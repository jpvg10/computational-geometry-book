Geometry formulas and algorithms (in Java) for programming contests.

Sources: a lot of googling. Uses of the determinant [here](https://www.purplemath.com/modules/detprobs.htm). Convex hull algorithm [here](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Algorithm_Implementation/Geometry/Convex_hull/Monotone_chain).

Figures were created using [GeoGebra](https://www.geogebra.org/).
